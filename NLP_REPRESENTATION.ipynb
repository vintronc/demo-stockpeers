        "One morning last week, I was walking my son to pre-kindergarten when we spotted one of his friends strolling toward us with his parents—ominously, away from school. A lone sparrow trilled in warning; a distant bell tolled. A classmate had tested positive for covid-19. In accordance with city protocols, the entire class was sent home to quarantine for at least five days. I am lucky to be able to work from home and at odd hours, because when you order little kids into quarantine you effectively send their parents into semi-isolation, too. In the idle days that followed, I alternated between frustration that my son wanted so much of my attention and guilt that he was cooped up with such a distracted roommate; I almost wished he were more of a TV watcher. Most parents remember these claustrophobic cycles from the first, locked-down spring of the pandemic. But most of them have long since moved on.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was starting to feel like children under the age of five in New York City were the last people subject to strict pandemic mandates. On the day my son was sent home, at the Barclays Center (capacity: about seventeen thousand), the unvaccinated basketball player Kyrie Irving played his seventh home game since Mayor Eric Adams excused athletes and performers from the city’s vaccine mandate. Masks and proof of vaccination were not required at Madison Square Garden (capacity: eighteen thousand), where the Rangers played the Carolina Hurricanes. A mask would not have been required of me in the New Yorker offices, had I gone in. Mayor Adams was quarantining, too, having tested positive for covid-19 after a series of unmasked social engagements, including the Gridiron Club dinner, in Washington, D.C., which turned out to be a superspreader event. On Monday, the mask mandate for U.S. domestic flights and public transportation was struck down by a Trump-appointed federal judge. (The Department of Justice plans to appeal the ruling if the C.D.C. decides that a mandate is still necessary.) Sub-variants of Omicron continue to spread in New York and beyond, and, across the city’s public, private, and charter schools, weekly totals of positive cases more than tripled in the month leading up to April 9th. Yet the era of covid vigilance is over, it seems—that is, unless you are medically vulnerable or too young for kindergarten.\n",

        "In the New York City public-school system, only pre-K and 3-K students are still subject to “close-contact” restrictions: if they are exposed to covid at school, they must quarantine even if they produce a negative test result. They are also the only remaining students who must wear masks in school—the mask mandate for older children ended on March 7th. In private preschools and day-care centers, the more stringent rules also apply to children over the age of two and to educators. The mask mandate has sparked a lot of grumbling and, recently, some well-publicized demonstrations, and Mayor Adams appears eager to lift it—at one point, he even set a date of expiration, April 4th, only to back away. “I’m totally at the mercy of my health team,” he said on April 8th. “They stated that we’re continuing to look at the numbers. Once they are comfortable and will give me the orders, I’m chomping at the bit to get it done.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I reached out to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the agency that recommends covid policies to the Adams administration, in hopes of understanding why the strictest rules apply to the youngest children. Ostensibly, there is a simple explanation: the vast majority of them are not yet eligible for the vaccine, which is authorized only for children who are five and older. As a result, day cares, preschools, and pre-K classrooms “have a low baseline vaccination rate compared to most other settings,” Patrick Gallahue, the press secretary for the D.O.H.M.H., said in an e-mail. (Caregivers and educators in these settings are required to be fully vaccinated.) Kids who are too young for the vaccine are runny-nosed and hopeless about personal boundaries and inclined to chew on their masks, although Gallahue was more diplomatic: “Other available tools to mitigate the spread of covid-19 such as physical distancing and hand-washing are difficult to enforce among young children, making these tools less effective,” he wrote. He also pointed out that the city’s hospitalization rates among children ages four and under have been slightly higher than those for other pediatric age groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Those numbers are still extremely low: just over two per one hundred thousand for the week ending April 9th. “In total, this disease is not as severe in children as it is in adults,” Rick Malley, a pediatric infectious-disease physician at Boston Children’s Hospital and a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, told me. “But you can understand why some people are a little worried when the messaging goes toward ‘covid is not dangerous for children,’ because kids have died of covid. As a clinician in infectious diseases, I have seen my share of children for whom that statement would seem ludicrous, given what they are experiencing.” Thirty-six children under the age of eighteen have died of covid in New York City since the pandemic began, including a four-month-old, a four-year-old, and a five-year-old. A child dying of covid is rare, but rarity is irrelevant to that child’s parents, siblings, teachers, and friends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lingering effects—which is the terminology that Malley prefers over “long covid”—are also significantly rarer in children than in adults. But, he said, “It’s important in medicine, particularly with a new disease, to be a little humble and a little careful about how we message it.” He went on, “You’re trying to balance the risk of covid-related illness and lingering effects in a child versus all the collateral damage of what we’re doing: keeping them out of school, having to learn through a mask, the stress of not having child care.” He suggested the idea of a “test-to-stay” strategy for exposed preschoolers—the same regimen that applies to New York City’s K-12 students, which relies on self-administration of moderately reliable rapid home tests and, at least in some schools, operates more or less on the honor system.\n",

        "There has never been a consensus on covid protocols for very young children. Until recently, the C.D.C. recommended indoor masking for everyone ages two and up in school settings, including older children who are vaccinated. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends masking for “all individuals who are 2 years of age and older when the community level risk is considered ‘high.’ ” But the World Health Organization does not recommend masks for children ages five and under at all, and mask mandates in some European Union countries, including France, Spain, and Italy, start at age six. In February, five scholars at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health and Teachers College published an open letter, co-signed by hundreds of health professionals, arguing that scientific evidence did not support an end to indoor mask mandates in schools.\n",
        "\n",
        "In March and April, however, a nascent unmasking movement gained some traction in New York City. A group of parents filed a lawsuit challenging the under-five mask mandate; a State Supreme Court judge struck it down, but the rule remained in place as the city appealed. Parents staged “Unmask Our Toddlers” rallies in front of City Hall; at one, the kids in attendance chanted “Burn your mask!” and “See my smile!” In the theatre district, the day after Adams attended the covid-riddled Gridiron Club dinner, a group yelled “Unmask our toddlers!” as he arrived for a performance of the musical “Paradise Square.” In yet another City Hall protest, giant inflatable babies waddled around with signs that read “NYC Toddlers Have Been Masked for Half Their Lives” and “Toddlers Have Lowest Risk for Covid But Highest Risk for Developmental Delays.”\n",
        "\n",
        "These protesters are a different breed of anti-masker: they are able to cite science and data to support their cause, and their position echoes that of some physicians and educators. A March 18th open letter, addressed to Adams and signed by fifty-six health professionals, opposed continuing the under-five mask mandate, stating, “It is simply not true that toddlers face increased risk from COVID compared to other children, so there is no rationale to continue to deny them the normal daily experience of life that the rest of NYC’s children can now enjoy.” The letter enumerated potential developmental risks associated with prolonged face-covering, including delays in speech recognition, literacy, and social-emotional cognition. A preschool director in Manhattan told me that masking is hard on all of her students, but that it’s most difficult for children with speech and language delays or hearing impairments: the teachers and students can’t see one another making sounds, and the sounds themselves are muffled.\n",
        "\n",
        "In an inevitably high-pitched debate, one that inspires headlines such as “The Cult of Masked Schoolchildren,” what has been lost is that most parents and educators have long wanted an end to masking and quarantine protocols, and have simply disagreed on what threshold should prompt it—should they end when hospitalization rates fall below a certain level, say, or only after vaccines are authorized for young children? I would love for my son and his buddies and teachers to see one another’s faces, and I would like to feel confident that school will be open when we arrive for drop-off. Yet sometimes I walk past a bar or restaurant, jam-packed with naked-faced patrons, and I feel grateful that one of my kids is still cordoned off in a kind of exclusive, pre-vaccine anteroom. Unfortunately, his safe space during a quarantine is also the space where I take video calls for work.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, I can understand some of the sentiments animating the “Unmask Our Toddlers” demonstrations. But the protesters at these events are predominantly white women, and, in a city as diverse as ours, it’s worth pausing over why that might be. I think it’s a reflection, at least in part, of the disproportionate toll of the coronavirus. Black and brown families have had ample reason to protest throughout the pandemic: they are more likely to have lost a loved one to covid and more likely to have suffered financial hardship, school disruptions, and child-care crises. Nationwide, more than two hundred thousand children have lost a parent or primary caregiver to covid; Black and Hispanic children are twice as likely as white children to have suffered such a loss. According to data from the Harvard Medical School, a Black child is more than five times as likely as a white child to die of the coronavirus. These statistics are not necessarily front of mind for the people who gathered outside the Ethel Barrymore Theatre to yell at the city’s Black mayor about his covid policies for kids.\n",
        "\n",
        "The toddler mask mandate in New York City will almost certainly end soon, which will count as a victory, however belated, for the parents who have been protesting against it. One might hope that some of them can use that momentum to pursue a more holistic and inclusive brand of advocacy for health and safety standards in schools, one that does not necessarily zero in on a single policy for a single age group. The pandemic has brought into sharp relief any number of systemic, interconnected inequities that are worth yelling about: ventilation in schools, access to vaccines, access to mental-health care, access to special-education services. These are much harder to remedy, and affect many more children, than the mask mandate. They demand a kind of sustained collective action that cannot succeed in isolation.'''"

They loaded up a truck and all this was delivered through a postal company,\\\" said the 27-year-old, dressed in a yellow hoodie.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">They started with these, their most recent and most popular publications, many of which are children's books.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">The western city of Lviv has remained relatively sheltered from war since Russia invaded two months ago, with the exception of deadly airstrikes near the railway last week.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">Hundreds of thousands of people, mainly women and children, have fled to or through the country's cultural capital since the fighting erupted.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">\\\"I don't know how my colleagues in Kharkiv have stayed there,\\\" Yaremyn said.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">\\\"Those who fled and stayed with me said they felt that they wanted to level the city to the ground.\\\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">Yaremyn said the bookshop swiftly reopened a day after the invasion, providing shelter in the basement when the air raid sirens went off, and holding reading sessions there with displaced children.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">During the first wave of arrivals, parents who had left home with next to nothing flooded in seeking fairy tales to keep their children distracted in the bunkers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">A few parents bought \\\"Polinka\\\", the story of a girl and her grandfather, published just before the invasion and written by a man who is now on the front.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">\\\"He wanted to leave something behind for his grandchild,\\\" she said.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">From the shelves in the adult section, Yaremyn pulled out a collection of essays on Ukrainian women forgotten by history. Its writer too is now fighting the Russians, she said.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">\\\"A lot of our authors are in the army now,\\\" she said.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">As sirens wail across Lviv to signal the end of a morning air raid alarm, baristas return to their coffee shops to fire up their espresso machines until the next warning.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">The sun pours down from a blue sky, and a young man and woman press their heads together seated on a terrasse. The city's numerous bookshops are open for business.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">In a pedestrian tunnel under a road in the city centre, several tiny stalls sell translations of foreign classics like George Orwell's \\\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\\" or even manga titles.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">Near the Royal Arsenal museum, a pigeon sits on the head of a tall muscular statue of Ivan Fyodorov, a 16th-century printer from Moscow buried in Lviv.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">At his feet, when it does not rain and there are no sirens, a few second-hand booksellers wait for customers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">Dressed in a light blue coat and woolly hat, Iryna, 48, sat near rows of literature and history books for sale or rent. Rentals for a small fee used to be popular with the older generation, she said.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">Iryna, who did not give her second name, said she stopped working for more than a month after the war broke out.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">When she returned to the cobbled square in early April, many parents from the east came looking for books for their children. \\\"I gave them a lot because kids want to read,\\\" she said.</p>\",\n",

They loaded up a truck and all this was delivered through a postal company,\" said the 27-year-old, dressed in a yellow hoodie.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">They started with these, their most recent and most popular publications, many of which are children's books.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">The western city of Lviv has remained relatively sheltered from war since Russia invaded two months ago, with the exception of deadly airstrikes near the railway last week.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">Hundreds of thousands of people, mainly women and children, have fled to or through the country's cultural capital since the fighting erupted.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">\"I don't know how my colleagues in Kharkiv have stayed there,\" Yaremyn said.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">\"Those who fled and stayed with me said they felt that they wanted to level the city to the ground.\"</p><p class=\"bodytext\">Yaremyn said the bookshop swiftly reopened a day after the invasion, providing shelter in the basement when the air raid sirens went off, and holding reading sessions there with displaced children.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">During the first wave of arrivals, parents who had left home with next to nothing flooded in seeking fairy tales to keep their children distracted in the bunkers.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">A few parents bought \"Polinka\", the story of a girl and her grandfather, published just before the invasion and written by a man who is now on the front.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">\"He wanted to leave something behind for his grandchild,\" she said.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">From the shelves in the adult section, Yaremyn pulled out a collection of essays on Ukrainian women forgotten by history. Its writer too is now fighting the Russians, she said.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">\"A lot of our authors are in the army now,\" she said.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">As sirens wail across Lviv to signal the end of a morning air raid alarm, baristas return to their coffee shops to fire up their espresso machines until the next warning.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">The sun pours down from a blue sky, and a young man and woman press their heads together seated on a terrasse. The city's numerous bookshops are open for business.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">In a pedestrian tunnel under a road in the city centre, several tiny stalls sell translations of foreign classics like George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" or even manga titles.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">Near the Royal Arsenal museum, a pigeon sits on the head of a tall muscular statue of Ivan Fyodorov, a 16th-century printer from Moscow buried in Lviv.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">At his feet, when it does not rain and there are no sirens, a few second-hand booksellers wait for customers.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">Dressed in a light blue coat and woolly hat, Iryna, 48, sat near rows of literature and history books for sale or rent. Rentals for a small fee used to be popular with the older generation, she said.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">Iryna, who did not give her second name, said she stopped working for more than a month after the war broke out.</p><p class=\"bodytext\">When she returned to the cobbled square in early April, many parents from the east came looking for books for their children. \"I gave them a lot because kids want to read,\" she said.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"container ad-320-1023 nl-optin-mobile\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 optin-alignment\" ><div class=\"opt_widget_main\"><div class=\"clm-1\" ><div class=\"content\"><h4>Get a round-up of the day's top stories in your inbox</h4><form id=\"newsletters_manage-firstm-1104008\" class=\"needs-validation optin_newsletter\" novalidate=\"\" ><div id=\"agree_container_3_0\"></div><div class=\"input-group\"><div id=\"agree_container_3_0\"></div><input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email Address\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"optin_email\" pattern=\"[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\\.[a-z]{2,4}$\" required=\"\"><span class=\"input-group-btn\"><button data-lid=\"63\" class=\"btn\" id=\"optin_btn\" value=\"validate\">Sign Up</button></span><div class = \"errs inline\"></div><div class=\"valid-feedback feedback-pos\"> A verification email has been sent to your inbox.

They loaded up a truck and all this was delivered through a postal company,\\\\\" said the 27-year-old, dressed in a yellow hoodie.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">They started with these, their most recent and most popular publications, many of which are children\\'s books.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">The western city of Lviv has remained relatively sheltered from war since Russia invaded two months ago, with the exception of deadly airstrikes near the railway last week.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">Hundreds of thousands of people, mainly women and children, have fled to or through the country\\'s cultural capital since the fighting erupted.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">\\\\\"I don\\'t know how my colleagues in Kharkiv have stayed there,\\\\\" Yaremyn said.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">\\\\\"Those who fled and stayed with me said they felt that they wanted to level the city to the ground.\\\\\"</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">Yaremyn said the bookshop swiftly reopened a day after the invasion, providing shelter in the basement when the air raid sirens went off, and holding reading sessions there with displaced children.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">During the first wave of arrivals, parents who had left home with next to nothing flooded in seeking fairy tales to keep their children distracted in the bunkers.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">A few parents bought \\\\\"Polinka\\\\\", the story of a girl and her grandfather, published just before the invasion and written by a man who is now on the front.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">\\\\\"He wanted to leave something behind for his grandchild,\\\\\" she said.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">From the shelves in the adult section, Yaremyn pulled out a collection of essays on Ukrainian women forgotten by history. Its writer too is now fighting the Russians, she said.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">\\\\\"A lot of our authors are in the army now,\\\\\" she said.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">As sirens wail across Lviv to signal the end of a morning air raid alarm, baristas return to their coffee shops to fire up their espresso machines until the next warning.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">The sun pours down from a blue sky, and a young man and woman press their heads together seated on a terrasse. The city\\'s numerous bookshops are open for business.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">In a pedestrian tunnel under a road in the city centre, several tiny stalls sell translations of foreign classics like George Orwell\\'s \\\\\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\\\\" or even manga titles.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">Near the Royal Arsenal museum, a pigeon sits on the head of a tall muscular statue of Ivan Fyodorov, a 16th-century printer from Moscow buried in Lviv.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">At his feet, when it does not rain and there are no sirens, a few second-hand booksellers wait for customers.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">Dressed in a light blue coat and woolly hat, Iryna, 48, sat near rows of literature and history books for sale or rent. Rentals for a small fee used to be popular with the older generation, she said.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">Iryna, who did not give her second name, said she stopped working for more than a month after the war broke out.</p>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n<p class=\\\\\"bodytext\\\\\">When she returned to the cobbled square in early April, many parents from the east came looking for books for their children. \\\\\"I gave them a lot because kids want to read,\\\\\" she said.</p>\",\\n    \"articleSection\": \"International\",\\n    \"keywords\": \"Ukraine,Russia,Children\\'s

In Ukraine\\'s Lviv, war reaches even children\\'s booksIn Ukraine\\'s Lviv, war reaches even children\\'s booksAFP,  Apr 26 2022, 12:30 istupdated: Apr 26 2022, 13:05 istIn the basement of the bookshop she manages in western Ukraine, Romana Yaremyn shows hundreds of books stacked halfway to the ceiling after they were evacuated from the country\\'s war-torn east.Packed together in white parcels, the titles rescued from Kharkiv fill up what was once the children\\'s reading room.They are just a fraction of those at the shop\\'s publishing house in the eastern city under Russian fire, she said.\"Our warehouse workers tried to at least evacuate some of the books. They loaded up a truck and all this was delivered through a postal company,\" said the 27-year-old, dressed in a yellow hoodie.They started with these, their most recent and most popular publications, many of which are children\\'s books.The western city of Lviv has remained relatively sheltered from war since Russia invaded two months ago, with the exception of deadly airstrikes near the railway last week.Hundreds of thousands of people, mainly women and children, have fled to or through the country\\'s cultural capital since the fighting erupted.\"I don\\'t know how my colleagues in Kharkiv have stayed there,\" Yaremyn said.\"Those who fled and stayed with me said they felt that they wanted to level the city to the ground.\"Yaremyn said the bookshop swiftly reopened a day after the invasion, providing shelter in the basement when the air raid sirens went off, and holding reading sessions there with displaced children.During the first wave of arrivals, parents who had left home with next to nothing flooded in seeking fairy tales to keep their children distracted in the bunkers.A few parents bought \"Polinka\", the story of a girl and her grandfather, published just before the invasion and written by a man who is now on the front.\"He wanted to leave something behind for his grandchild,\" she said.From the shelves in the adult section, Yaremyn pulled out a collection of essays on Ukrainian women forgotten by history. Its writer too is now fighting the Russians, she said.\"A lot of our authors are in the army now,\" she said.As sirens wail across Lviv to signal the end of a morning air raid alarm, baristas return to their coffee shops to fire up their espresso machines until the next warning.The sun pours down from a blue sky, and a young man and woman press their heads together seated on a terrasse. The city\\'s numerous bookshops are open for business.In a pedestrian tunnel under a road in the city centre, several tiny stalls sell translations of foreign classics like George Orwell\\'s \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" or even manga titles.Near the Royal Arsenal museum, a pigeon sits on the head of a tall muscular statue of Ivan Fyodorov, a 16th-century printer from Moscow buried in Lviv.At his feet, when it does not rain and there are no sirens, a few second-hand booksellers wait for customers.Dressed in a light blue coat and woolly hat, Iryna, 48, sat near rows of literature and history books for sale or rent. Rentals for a small fee used to be popular with the older generation, she said.Iryna, who did not give her second name, said she stopped working for more than a month after the war broke out.When she returned to the cobbled square in early April, many parents from the east came looking for books for their children. \"I gave them a lot because kids want to read,\" she said.Get a round-up of the day\\'s top stories in your inboxSign Up A verification email has been sent to your inbox.
